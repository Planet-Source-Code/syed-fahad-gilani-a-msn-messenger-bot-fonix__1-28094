These are the commands the OTHER person can do while messaging you, these can be used by 
people who usually keep their computers on at work or home and want to access things from another
MSN messenger :D

Apart from that.. BEEP and JOKE can be used by anyone.. the rest of the commands require that u
give em a password (set from the main program!)

Thanks for using it
